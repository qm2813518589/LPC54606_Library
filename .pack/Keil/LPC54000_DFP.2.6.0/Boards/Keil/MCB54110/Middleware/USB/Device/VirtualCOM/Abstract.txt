This is an Virtual COM example that demonstrates Communication Device Class (CDC)
Abstract Control Model (ACM) on USB Device.

It demonstrates a bridge between USB Virtual COM Port and UART port on the
evaluation board.

Detailed description is available on:
www.keil.com/pack/doc/MW/USB/html/dev_cdc_tutorial.html

Board:                  Keil 'MCB54110'
Microcontroller:        NXP  'LPC54114'
Clock Settings:         IRC                  =  12 MHz
                        CPU                  = 100 MHz

Bridge functionality:   USB   <-> USART0

The PC will install a Virtual COM Port on the PC (see Driver Installation).
After installation an additional port "MCB54110 USB VCOM Port(COMx)"
can be found under System/Hardware/Device Manager/Ports(COM&LPT).
Number "x" is not fixed as different PC configuration may have different
"x" displayed in the device manager. The USB Host driver assigns "x"
dynamically based on the existing COM port configuration in the system.

Testing the USB Virtual COM Port:

  Connect USB Host PC with USB cable to USB connector on the embedded board.
  Connect PC UART Port with UART cable to USART connector on the embedded board.
  Open two Serial Terminal applications in Windows:
    -  one with "MCB54110 USB VCOM Port(COMx)"
    -  one with PC UART Port
  Data sent from one Serial Terminal application should be received in other and vice versa.

The program is available for target(s):

  - LPC54110 Flash: Downloads to and executes from internal Flash

Important Note: UART0 also is used for ISP so first power-up the board and then
                connect the UART cable to UART0 port
                MCB54110 does not have routed flow control pins on the UART
                so it is possible that this example will loose characters
                because of not using flow control

                                32-bit Host PCs.
    - mcb54110-vcom_amd64.cat : Digitally signed driver catalog file for
                                64-bit Host PCs.

Note : Digitally signing of the driver catalog file is required to install
drivers on 64-bit PCs using Windows Vista or later Windows versions. Please
refer to Microsoft documentation for further information.


Driver Installation:
--------------------
     "Welcome to the Found New Hardware Wizard" appears
     - select 'No, not this time'
     - press  'Next'

     - select 'Install from a list or specific location (Advanced)'
     - press  'Next'

     - select 'Search for the best driver in these locations'
     - check  'include this location in the search'
     - set to <project folder>
     - press 'Next'

     "Hardware Installation" appears
     "has not passed Windows Logo testing..."
     - press 'Continue Anyway'

     "Completing the Found New Hardware Wizard" appears
     - press 'Finish'

NOTE:
  - 3.3V power supply must be selected (with VDD_LPC jumper)
  - Jumper 4 ISP/RST should not connect any pins (no RS232, no LINK) to avoid
    resetting the board with RS232 handshake signals. 
  - Jumper 5 RXD and TXD must be in position RS232 to use the RS232 connector.
    If you want to use the virtual COM port of the CMSIS-DAP interface, you 
    can put jumper 5 RXD and TXD to position LINK.
  - DMA is used by USART Driver -> DMA_IRQHandler, in keil_startup_lpc5411x.s,
                                   is overwritten with Chip_DMASERVICE_Isr.
