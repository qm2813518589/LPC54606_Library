The 'Blinky' project is a simple CMSIS RTOS based example for
NXP 'LPC54114' microcontroller using Keil MCB54110 Evaluation Board,
compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - fro_12m  =  12.00 MHz
   - pll_clk  = 100.00 MHz
   - main_clk = 100.00 MHz

 - LEDs are blinking as running light
 - blinking speed depends on potentiometer position
 - blinking is paused while holding down the USER button
 

The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  LPC54114 RAM:         configured for on-chip RAM
                        (used for target debugging)

  LPC54114 Flash:       runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                        (used for production or target debugging)

  LPC54114 SWO:         runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                        configured for exception trace & SWO
                        (used for production or target debugging)
