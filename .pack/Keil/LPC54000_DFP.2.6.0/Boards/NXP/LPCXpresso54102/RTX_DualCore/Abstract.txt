The 'DualCore' multi project demonstrates how to configure dual core application projects
in order to use LPC54102 M4 core together with LPC54102 M0+ core.

To debug this dual-core application, you need to run two instances of uVision.
Each instance contains a project for one of the cores and needs to be in debug mode.

Example functionality (M4):
 - Clock Settings:
   - IRC     =  12 MHz
   - CPU     = 100 MHz  (96MHz for chip revision 1B, 1C) 

 - CM4 synchronizes via mailbox with CM0+
 - CM4 passes LED state via mailbox to CM0+
 - CM0+ switches LEDs according LED state
 
Note:
   CM0+ application must be build first using CM0+ project.
   CM0+ application is flashed together with CM4 application from CM4 project.
   CM4 application configures CM0+ stack pointer and reset vector and release CM0+ core from reset.

   Please see ./CM4/Abstract.txt.
   Please see ./CM0plus/Abstract.txt.
