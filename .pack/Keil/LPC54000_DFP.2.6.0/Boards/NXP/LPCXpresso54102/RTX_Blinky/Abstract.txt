The 'RTX_Blinky' project is a simple CMSIS RTOS Kernel based example for
NXP 'LPC54102' microcontroller using NXP 'LPCXpresso54102' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - IRC     =  12 MHz
   - CPU     = 100 MHz  (96MHz for chip revision 1B, 1C) 

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor
driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of
the four output driver stages:


- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  LPC54102 Flash:   configured for on-chip Flash
                    (used for production or target debugging)

  LPC54102 RAM:     runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                    (may be used for target debugging)
