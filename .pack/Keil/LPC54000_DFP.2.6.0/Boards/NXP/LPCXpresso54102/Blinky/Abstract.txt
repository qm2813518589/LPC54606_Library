The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for
NXP 'LPC54102' microcontroller using NXP 'LPCXpresso54102' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - IRC     =  12 MHz
   - CPU     = 100 MHz  (96MHz for chip revision 1B, 1C) 

 - 3 LEDs blink with a fixed speed


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  LPC54102 Flash:       runs from on-chip Flash
                        (used for production or target debugging)

  LPC54102 RAM:         runs from on-chip RAM
                        (used for target debugging)

  LPC54102 SWO:         runs from on-chip Flash
                        (configured for exception trace & SWO)
