The 'CM4 Blinky' project is part of a simple DualCore example for
NXP 'LPC54102' microcontroller using NXP 'LPCXpresso54102' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).

This example demonstrates how to configure a dual core application project
in order to use Cortex-M0+ core together with the Cortex-M4 core.

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - IRC     =  12 MHz
   - CPU     = 100 MHz  (96MHz for chip revision 1B, 1C) 

 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - CM4 passes address of LED state variable via mailbox to CM0+
 - CM0+ changes value of LED state variable
 - CM4 lits LEDs according value of LED state variable


The CM4 Blinky program is available for target:

  LPC54102 Flash:      configured for on-chip Flash
                       (used for production or target debugging)


Note:
   CM0+ application must be build first using CM0+ project.
   CM0+ application is flashed together with CM4 application from CM4 project.
   CM4 application configures CM0+ stack pointer and reset vector and release CM0+ core from reset.
