The 'RTX_Blinky' project is a simple CMSIS RTOS Kernel based example for
NXP 'LPC54608' microcontroller using NXP 'LPCXpresso54608' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - IRC     =  12 MHz
   - CPU     =  96 MHz 

 - 3 LEDs blinks with a fixed speed, determined by SysTick Timer working in interrupt mode.
 - blinking is paused while holding down a button (SW2 .. SW5).


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  LPC54608 Flash:   configured for on-chip Flash
                    (used for production or target debugging)

  LPC54608 RAM:     runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                    (may be used for target debugging)
