The 'CM0plus Blinky' project is part of a simple CMSIS-RTOS DualCore example for
NXP 'LPC54114' microcontroller using NXP 'LPCXpresso54114' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).

This example demonstrates how to configure a dual core application project
in order to use Cortex-M0+ core together with the Cortex-M4 core.

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - IRC     =  12 MHz
   - CPU     = 100 MHz 

 - CM4 synchronizes via mailbox with CM0+
 - CM4 passes LED state via mailbox to CM0+
 - CM0+ switches LEDs axxording LED state


The CM0plus Blinky program is available for target:

  LPC54114 M0+ Flash:  configured for on-chip Flash
                       (used for production or target debugging)

Note:
  CM0+ application is flashed together with CM4 application from CM4 project.
  Debug of CM0+ application is possible after CM0+ application is started from CM4 application.
