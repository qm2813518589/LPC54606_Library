LPC5410x UART interrupt example with ring buffers
========================================================

Example description
-------------------
The UART example shows how to use the UART in interrupt mode with transmit
and receive ring buffers.<br>

To use the example, connect a serial cable to the board's RS232/UART port and
start a terminal program to monitor the port.  The terminal program on the host
PC should be setup for 115200-8-N-1.
Once the example is started, a small message is printed on terminal. Any data
received will be returned back to the caller.

Special connection requirements
-------------------------------
No Special connection is required.
